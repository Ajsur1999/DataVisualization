# DataVisualization
This is the Data Visualization project where I have analyzed the data and created interactive dashboard visualizations for analyzing the Electricity prices in the State of Texas. 

From the above data visualization project we can find out that

The electricity price in Texas has been in continuous fluctuation between the year 2019-2021. In 2019 the average price in Texas was $39.6 and it gradually reduced in 2020 to $25.2 and abruptly increased in 2021 to $721.9.

After conducting my analysis in Tableau, I can conclude that people in West region pay more price compared to the other three regions.

One more interesting find about the generation of electricity is that Gas-CC generates the maximum amount of electricity and biomass generates the least amount of electricity. This shows that if the electricity generated by a non-renewable source is more in supply the price will further increase to accommodate the cost of generation.
